The purpose of this paper is to argue that equating \u201cuser\u201d with flesh and blood \u201cpeople out there\u201d is na\u00efve. Not only that, it closes important options in conducting human-centered design. <\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design\/methodology\/approach<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p> \u2013 The authors conceptually elaborate a relational understanding of the user and integrate research findings on user representations found at the intersection of human-centered design and social studies of technology. <\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p> \u2013 The user is best understood as a relational term that bridges between people out there and renditions of them relevant for design. A distinction between \u201cuser representations\u201d and \u201cengaged use\u201d is a key distinction to clarify this further. Research to date demonstrates that R\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;\n\t\t\t\tD organizations have a wide range of user representations and positioning human-centered design to these would advance its likely yield. <\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations\/implications<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p> \u2013 The strategic positioning of user studies and other human-centered design within R\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;\n\t\t\t\tD organizations is a growing research area that merits further research. <\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p> \u2013 Descriptions of users would benefit from being more strategic in order to become viable amidst other design concerns. This can be aided by, for instance, visualizing the \u201cusers\u201d that different fractions in the company rely on and compare these to the users indicated by human-centered design. <\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality\/value<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p> \u2013 The paper makes an original reconceptualization of the user and integrates literature on user representations to open new options for conducting human-centered design.<\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1108\/itp-01-2014-0011","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,10]],"date-time":"2015-02-10T08:36:06Z","timestamp":1423557366000},"page":"72-89","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":11,"title":"The user as relational entity","prefix":"10.1108","volume":"28","author":[{"given":"Sampsa","family":"Hyysalo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mikael","family":"Johnson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"140","reference":[{"key":"key2020122600572197500_b1","unstructured":"Agre, P.E.\n                (1995), \u201cConceptions of the user in computer systems design\u201d, in \n                  Thomas, P.J.\n                (Ed.), \n                  The Social and Interactional Dimensions of Human-Computer Interfaces\n               , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 67-106."},{"key":"key2020122600572197500_b2","unstructured":"Akrich, M.\n                (1995), \u201cUser representations: practices, methods and sociology\u201d, in \n                  Rip, A.\n               , \n                  Misa, T.J.\n                and \n                  Schot, J.W.\n                (Eds), \n                  Managing Technology in Society, The Approach of Constructive Technology Assessment\n               , Pinter, London, pp. 167-184."},{"key":"key2020122600572197500_b3","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Becker, H.\n                (1998), \n                  Tricks of the Trade: How to Think About Your Research While You\u2019re Doing it\n               , University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.","DOI":"10.7208\/chicago\/9780226040998.001.0001"},{"key":"key2020122600572197500_b4","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Beyer, H.\n                and \n                  Holtzblatt, K.\n                (1998), \n                  Contextual Design: a Customer-Centered Approach to Systems Designs\n               , Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, CA.","DOI":"10.1145\/286498.286629"},{"key":"key2020122600572197500_b5","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"B\u00f8dker, K.\n               , \n                  Kensing, F.\n                and \n                  Simonsen, J.\n                (2004), \n                  Participatory IT Design: Designing for Business and Workplace Realities\n               , The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.","DOI":"10.7551\/mitpress\/5249.001.0001"},{"key":"key2020122600572197500_b6","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Botero, A.\n                and \n                  Hyysalo, S.\n                (2013), \u201cAgeing together: steps towards evolutionary co-design in everyday practices\u201d, \n                  CoDesign\n               , Vol. 9 No. 1, pp. 37-54.","DOI":"10.1080\/15710882.2012.760608"},{"key":"key2020122600572197500_b7","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Buur, J.\n                and \n                  Sitorus, L.\n                (2007), \u201cEthnography as design provocation\u201d, Ethnographic Praxis in Industry Conference Proceedings, pp. 146-157.","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1559-8918.2007.tb00071.x"},{"key":"key2020122600572197500_b8","unstructured":"Bylund, M.\n               , \n                  Johnson, M.\n               , \n                  Lehmuskallio, A.\n               , \n                  Seipel, P.\n                and \n                  Tamminen, S.\n                (2010), \u201cPRIMA \u2014 privacy research through the perspective of a multidisciplinary mash up\u201d, in \n                  Greenstein, S.\n                (Ed.), \n                  Vem Reglerar Informationssamh\u00e4llet?
