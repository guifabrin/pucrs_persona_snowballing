This research builds a model that hypothesizes that the user experiences from social interactions among users, operationalized as personalization, transparency, access to social resources, critical mass of social acquaintances, and risk, as well as with the technical features of the social media platform, operationalized as the completeness, flexibility, integration, and evolvability, influence user engagement and subsequent usage behavior. Using survey responses from 408 social media users, findings suggest that both social and technical factors impact user engagement and ultimately usage with additional direct impacts on usage by perceptions of the critical mass of social acquaintances and risk.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/joeuc.2016040104","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,21]],"date-time":"2016-03-21T12:21:43Z","timestamp":1458562903000},"page":"53-73","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":41,"title":"Social Media Engagement Theory","prefix":"10.4018","volume":"28","author":[{"given":"Paul M.","family":"Di Gangi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"}]},{"given":"Molly M.","family":"Wasko","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Management, Information Systems and Quantitative Methods, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA"}]}],"member":"2432","container-title":"Journal of Organizational and End User Computing","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.igi-global.com\/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=148146","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]],"date-time":"2020-06-23T20:17:00Z","timestamp":1592943420000},"score":1,"subtitle":["Exploring the Influence of User Engagement on Social Media Usage"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2"},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4018\/JOEUC.2016040104","relation":{},"ISSN":["1546-2234","1546-5012"],"subject":["Strategy and Management","Computer Science Applications","Human-Computer Interaction"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2016,4]]}}
