To do this, Cognitive Engineering intersects with the sensor development and military operations communities. Through the use of scenario-based design and the Topic Landscape tool, generic patterns provide seeds that help envision realistic futures of MOUT which are expressed in a narrative. These patterns provide insight on two levels: On one level they describe complexities inherent to all cognitive work, while on another level they provide insight about what makes MOUT difficult. The Topic Landscape is a collaborative tool that organizes information from a Cognitive Task Analysis of MOUT in many forms (text, graphics, video, etc.) from many contributors. This approach turns scenarios from a validation tool to an effective envisioning tool. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/154193120504902408","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,19]],"date-time":"2012-01-19T23:32:35Z","timestamp":1327015955000},"page":"2105-2108","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Scenarios as a Tool for Design Envisioning: Using the Case of New Sensor Technologies for Military Urban Operations","prefix":"10.1177","volume":"49","author":[{"given":"Joshua","family":"Schoenwald","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH"}]},{"given":"Stoney","family":"Trent","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH"}]},{"given":"James","family":"Tittle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH"}]},{"given":"David","family":"Woods","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,5]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-154193120504902408","first-page":"181","volume":"10","author":"Carroll J.
