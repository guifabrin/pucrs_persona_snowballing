These are designing for non-goals (things you wish the user not to be able to do); creating anti-usability (designing so that it is difficult to achieve the non-goals); and clean design (solutions without unwanted side-effects that then have to have solutions designed for them). Slanty design incorporates many of the concepts of socio-technical approaches, and is explained using a variety of examples, including an airport baggage carousel, and the remaining challenges outstanding are described.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/978-1-60960-507-0.ch004","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,5,25]],"date-time":"2011-05-25T08:29:43Z","timestamp":1306312183000},"page":"57-63","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Socially-Aware Design","prefix":"10.4018","author":[{"given":"Russell","family":"Beale","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Birmingham, UK"}]}],"member":"2432","reference":[{"key":"978-1-60960-507-0.ch004.-1","article-title":"User-Centered Design","author":"C.Abras","year":"2004","journal-title":"Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction"},{"key":"978-1-60960-507-0.ch004.-2","unstructured":"BBC.
