Teaching model development is reported across four time periods. During Period 1 (1994-1999) the model was studied in a five-year case study using design and development research and is summarized using the Models of Teaching framework (Joyce, Weil, &amp; Calhoun, 2014). Period 2 (1999-2001) reports the use of scenarios to test out new participation structures within the model. Period 3 (2001-2006) documents how the model was used in blended deliveries. Period 4 (2007-2016) summarizes changes in teaching procedures and participation when the course was delivered totally online. The chapter concludes with comments on developing a teaching model and a longitudinal agenda for studying one's teaching. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/978-1-5225-3873-8.ch004","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,26]],"date-time":"2017-09-26T12:21:12Z","timestamp":1506428472000},"page":"60-81","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Developing a Reflexive Teaching Model","prefix":"10.4018","author":[{"given":"Neal","family":"Shambaugh","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"West Virginia University, USA"}]}],"member":"2432","reference":[{"key":"978-1-5225-3873-8.ch004.-1","first-page":"74","article-title":"Systems inquiry and its application in education","author":"B.
