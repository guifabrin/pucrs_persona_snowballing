As Adlin and Pruitt (2006) explain, personas are useful because they put an individual, human face on demographic and ethnographic data which would otherwise be difficult to explain to software engineers, project managers, information product developers, and other stakeholders in a way they can easily conceptualize and apply. Usually on one sheet of paper, a persona will provide a photo of the character for the persona; a memorable name for the persona; a short bio or background information about the persona; the persona's goals for using the product being developed; a short and memorable quote from the persona which usually conveys their\n            <jats:italic>ethos<\/jats:italic>\n            ; and other information relevant to the use of the product being designed such as training; previous experience with similar products, or physical disabilities (such as arthritis or poor eye sight---see http:\/\/www.clemson.edu\/caah\/caah_mockups\/persona_clemsongrad.html for an example of personas developed for the redesign of a College's website).\n          <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/2644448.2644451","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,11]],"date-time":"2014-07-11T12:09:41Z","timestamp":1405080581000},"page":"10-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":27,"title":"Journey mapping","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"2","author":[{"given":"Tharon","family":"Howard","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Clemson University"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/2207676.2208572"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Pruitt J. & Adlin T.
