Journalists and copywriters need to find images that are not only visually appropriate to accompany the documents they are creating, but are acceptably priced and licensed. The paper aims to discuss these issues. <\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design\/methodology\/approach<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p> \u2013 A work-based study methodology and grounded theory are used to collect qualitative data from a variety of creative professionals including journalists. <\/jats:p>\n            <\/jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings<\/jats:title>\n               <jats:p> \u2013 The authors report the findings of a study to investigate image search, retrieval and use by creative professionals who routinely use images as part of their work in an online environment. The authors describe the commercial constraints that have an impact on the image users\u2019 behaviour that are not reported in other more academic and lab-based studies of image use (Westman, 2009).
