We design and implement a digital recording system that records identities and locations of objects (as advertised by their sensors) along with visual images (as recorded by a camera). The process, which we refer to as\n            <jats:italic>Sensor-Enhanced Video Annotation (SEVA)<\/jats:italic>\n            , combines a series of correlation, interpolation, and extrapolation techniques. It produces a tagged stream that later can be used to efficiently search for videos or frames containing particular objects or people. We present detailed experiments with a prototype of our system using both stationary and mobile objects as well as GPS and ultrasound. Our experiments show that: (i) SEVA has zero error rates for static objects, except very close to the boundary of the viewable area; (ii) for moving objects or a moving camera, SEVA only misses objects leaving or entering the viewable area by 1--2 frames; (iii) SEVA can scale to 10 fast-moving objects using current sensor technology; and (iv) SEVA runs online using relatively inexpensive hardware.\n          <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/1556134.1556141","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2009,8,11]],"date-time":"2009-08-11T13:29:23Z","timestamp":1249997363000},"page":"1-26","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":"SEVA","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"5","author":[{"given":"Xiaotao","family":"Liu","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"}]},{"given":"Mark","family":"Corner","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"}]},{"given":"Prashant","family":"Shenoy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1180639.1180857"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1240624.1240683"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1026653.1026656"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_4_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1027527.1027536"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_5_1","volume-title":"Proceedings of the 19th Annual Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies (InfoCom'00)","volume":"2","author":"Bahl P."},{"key":"e_1_2_1_6_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/MC.2002.993780"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_7_1","unstructured":"Barry B. 2005.
