A method combining UED and Kano model is proposed and applied to FFE of TRIZ theory. User study theory and methods in User-Experience Design (UED) are used to collecting user demand for new product, and Kano model is used to analyze the priority of user demands and translate user demands into function demands. The design of mobile application is illustrated as an example, this method is proved to be a perfect solution to form the design idea through analysis of user demand in FFE stage of new product development.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/amr.655-657.2052","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,3,11]],"date-time":"2013-03-11T17:07:18Z","timestamp":1363021638000},"page":"2052-2056","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Research of FFE in TRIZ Theory","prefix":"10.4028","volume":"655-657","author":[{"given":"Chao Lan","family":"Tang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Guangdong University of Technology"}]},{"given":"Xian","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Guangdong University of Technology"}]}],"member":"2457","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"1649043","unstructured":"Tan Runhua, TRIZ and Application[M], the first edition, Beijing Higher Education Press(2010)."},{"key":"1649044","unstructured":"Jef Raskin, The Human Interface: New Directions for Designing Interactive Systems[M], Addison-Wesley Professional( 2000)."},{"key":"1649045","unstructured":"Alan Cooper, Robert Reimann, David Cmnin, The Essentials of Interaction Design[M].
