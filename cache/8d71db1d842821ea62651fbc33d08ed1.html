From a popular social media account containing more than 30 million interactions by viewers from 198 countries engaging with more than 4,200 online videos produced by a global media corporation, we demonstrate that our methodology has several novel accomplishments, including: (a) identifying distinct user behavioral segments based on the user content consumption patterns; (b) identifying impactful demographics groupings; and (c) creating rich persona descriptions by automatically adding pertinent attributes, such as names, photos, and personal characteristics. We validate our approach by implementing the methodology into an actual working system; we then evaluate it via quantitative methods by examining the accuracy of predicting content preference of personas, the stability of the personas over time, and the generalizability of the method via applying to two other datasets. Research findings show the approach can develop rich personas representing the behavior and demographics of real audiences using privacy-preserving aggregated online social media data from major online platforms. Results have implications for media companies and other organizations distributing content via online platforms.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/3265986","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,1]],"date-time":"2018-11-01T12:18:14Z","timestamp":1541074694000},"page":"1-26","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":26,"title":"Imaginary People Representing Real Numbers","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"J.","family":"An","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Qatar Computing Research Institute, Hamad bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar"}]},{"given":"H.","family":"Kwak","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Qatar Computing Research Institute, Hamad bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar"}]},{"given":"S.","family":"Jung","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Qatar Computing Research Institute, Hamad bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar"}]},{"given":"J.","family":"Salminen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Qatar Computing Research Institute, Hamad bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar"}]},{"given":"M.","family":"Admad","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Strategy Division, Al Jazeera Media Network"}]},{"given":"B.","family":"Jansen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Qatar Computing Research Institute, Hamad bin Khalifa University, Doha, Qatar"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","volume-title":"Consumers and suppliers: Attention asymmetries.
