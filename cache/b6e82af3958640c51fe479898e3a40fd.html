To better understand and solidify the importance of the user within the technological artifact, these designers often create \u2018personas\u2019 \u2014 prototypical users with names, faces, interests and preferences. Personas serve as boundary objects used as conceptual stand-ins for users when team members make design decisions. This article traces the discursive construction of the \u2018user\u2019 within web design texts and how these texts describe the persona technique. The analysis suggests that the use of personas is motivated as much by political realities within new media organizations, as it is by the desire to address user needs. In addition, it is argued that personas serve to reinscribe the conceptual separation between the user and designer despite technological developments (like Web 2.0) that blur this boundary. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/1461444809346722","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,2,10]],"date-time":"2010-02-10T04:54:27Z","timestamp":1265777667000},"page":"401-416","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":47,"title":"Designing for imaginary friends: information architecture, personas and the politics of user-centered design","prefix":"10.1177","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"Adrienne L.","family":"Massanari","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Loyola University Chicago, USA,"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2010,2,9]]},"reference":[{"key":"atypb1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3998\/mpub.9904"},{"key":"atypb2","volume-title":"Design Studies: Theory and Research in Graphic Design","author":"Bennett, A.","year":"2006"},{"key":"atypb3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/016224399301800107"},{"key":"atypb4","volume-title":"Shaping Technology\/Building Society: Studies in Sociotechnical Change","author":"Bijker, W.E.","year":"1992"},{"key":"atypb5","volume-title":"\u2018Escaping Flatland\u2019","author":"Bisbort, A.","year":"1999"},{"key":"atypb6","volume-title":"Proceedings of the 2002 NordiCHI Conference","author":"Blomquist, \u00c5."},{"key":"atypb7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.7551\/mitpress\/5249.001.0001"},{"key":"atypb8","volume-title":"Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences","author":"Bowker, G.C.","year":"1999"},{"key":"atypb9","volume-title":"Communicating Design: Developing Web Site Documentation for Design and Planning","author":"Brown, D.M.","year":"2007"},{"key":"atypb10","unstructured":"Buchanan, R.
