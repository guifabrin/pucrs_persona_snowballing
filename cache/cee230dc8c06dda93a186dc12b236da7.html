A system of inferences of this kind is properly viewed as a theory because such states are not directly observable, and the system can be used to make predictions about the behavior of others. As to the mental states the chimpanzee may infer, consider those inferred by our own species, for example, <jats:italic>purpose<\/jats:italic> or <jats:italic>intention<\/jats:italic>, as well as <jats:italic>knowledge, belief, thinking, doubt, guessing, pretending, liking<\/jats:italic>, and so forth. To determine whether or not the chimpanzee infers states of this kind, we showed an adult chimpanzee a series of videotaped scenes of a human actor struggling with a variety of problems. Some problems were simple, involving inaccessible food \u2013 bananas vertically or horizontally out of reach, behind a box, and so forth \u2013 as in the original Kohler problems; others were more complex, involving an actor unable to extricate himself from a locked cage, shivering because of a malfunctioning heater, or unable to play a phonograph because it was unplugged. With each videotape the chimpanzee was given several photographs, one a solution to the problem, such as a stick for the inaccessible bananas, a key for the locked up actor, a lit wick for the malfunctioning heater. The chimpanzee's consistent choice of the correct photographs can be understood by assuming that the animal recognized the videotape as representing a problem, understood the actor's purpose, and chose alternatives compatible with that purpose.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0140525x00076512","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,2,5]],"date-time":"2010-02-05T01:36:01Z","timestamp":1265333761000},"page":"515-526","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3783,"title":"Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?","prefix":"10.1017","volume":"1","author":[{"given":"David","family":"Premack","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Guy","family":"Woodruff","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2010,2,4]]},"reference":[{"key":"S0140525X00076512_ref001","volume-title":"The Mentality of Apes","author":"K\u00f6hler","year":"1925"},{"key":"S0140525X00076512_ref004","unstructured":"Premack D.
