Patients and service users are a neglected user group, and there is a need for transparent reporting and critical review of methods used to co-produce knowledge with patients. This study aimed to explore the potential of participatory codesign methods as a mechanism of supporting knowledge sharing, and to evaluate this from the perspective of both researchers and patients.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>A knowledge mobilisation research project using participatory codesign workshops to explore patient involvement in using health data to improve services. To evaluate involvement in the project, multiple qualitative data sources were collected throughout, including a survey informed by the Generic Learning Outcomes framework, an evaluation focus group, and field notes. Analysis was a collective dialogic reflection on project processes and impacts, including comparing and contrasting the key issues from the researcher and contributor perspectives.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Authentic involvement was seen as the result of \u201cspace to talk\u201d and \u201cspace to change\u201d. \"Space to talk\" refers to creating space for shared dialogue, including space for tension and disagreement, and recognising contributor and researcher expertise as equally valuable to the discussion. \u2018Space to change\u2019 refers to space to adapt in response to contributor feedback. These were partly facilitated by the use of codesign methods which emphasise visual and iterative working, but contributors emphasised that relational openness was more crucial, and that this needed to apply to the study overall (specifically, how contributors were reimbursed as a demonstration of how their input was valued) to build trust, not just to processes within the workshops.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Specific methods used within involvement are only one component of effective involvement practice. The relationship between researcher and contributors, and particularly researcher willingness to change their approach in response to feedback, were considered most important by contributors. Productive tension was emphasised as a key mechanism in leading to genuinely hybrid outputs that combined contributor insight and experience with academic knowledge and understanding.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1186\/s40900-021-00262-5","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,31]],"date-time":"2021-05-31T10:04:32Z","timestamp":1622455472000},"update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"More than a method: trusting relationships, productive tensions, and two-way learning as mechanisms of authentic co-production","prefix":"10.1186","volume":"7","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0863-5866","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sarah E.","family":"Knowles","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Dawn","family":"Allen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ailsa","family":"Donnelly","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jackie","family":"Flynn","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kay","family":"Gallacher","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Annmarie","family":"Lewis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Grace","family":"McCorkle","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Manoj","family":"Mistry","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Pat","family":"Walkington","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jess","family":"Drinkwater","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,31]]},"reference":[{"issue":"1","key":"262_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"50","DOI":"10.1186\/1748-5908-7-50","volume":"7","author":"JM Grimshaw","year":"2012","unstructured":"Grimshaw JM, Eccles MP, Lavis JN, Hill SJ, Squires JE.
