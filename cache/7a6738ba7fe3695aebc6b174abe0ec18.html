This paper presents the first step of a UCD using a persona, a fictitious character representing the targeted population, which in this case is people having sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The persona is used to better understand the possible interactions of a TBI population with a prototype of a technology that we wish to develop, namely the Cognitive Orthosis for coOKing (COOK). COOK is meant to be an assistive technology that will be designed to promote independence for cooking within a supported-living residence. More specifically, this paper presents the persona\u2019s creation methodology based on the first four phases of the persona\u2019s lifecycle. It also describes how the persona methodology served as a facilitator to initiate an interdisciplinary collaboration between a clinical team and a computer science team. Creation of personas relied on a clinical model (Disability Creation Process) that contextualized the needs of this population and an evaluation tool [Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Profile] that presented a wide range of cognitive assistance needs found in this same population. This paper provides an in-depth description of some of the most frequent everyday difficulties experienced by individuals with TBI as well as the persona\u2019s abilities, limitations and social participation during the realization of IADL, and an evaluation of the manifestations of these difficulties during IADL performance as represented through scenarios. The interdisciplinary team used the persona to complete a first description of the interactions of a persona with TBI with COOK. This work is an attempt at offering a communication tool, the persona, to facilitate interdisciplinary research among diverse disciplines who wish to learn to develop a common language, models and methodologies at the beginning of the design process.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/iwcomp\/iwab002","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,22]],"date-time":"2021-04-22T17:51:33Z","timestamp":1619113893000},"page":"435-456","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Use of a Persona to Support the Interdisciplinary Design of an Assistive Technology for Meal Preparation in Traumatic Brain Injury","prefix":"10.1093","volume":"32","author":[{"given":"Marisnel","family":"Olivares","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"DOMUS, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, 2500, boul. de l\u2019Universit\u00e9, Sherbrooke, J1K 2R1, CAN"},{"name":"Lab-STIC \/ IMT Atlantique Bretagne, 655 Av du Technopole, Brest 29200, FRA"}]},{"given":"H\u00e9l\u00e8ne","family":"Pigot","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"DOMUS, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, 2500, boul. de l\u2019Universit\u00e9, Sherbrooke, J1K 2R1, CAN"},{"name":"Centre de recherche sur le vieillissement, 1036, rue Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Sud, Sherbrooke J1H 4C4, CAN"},{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal - Institut universitaire sur la r\u00e9adaptation en d\u00e9ficience physique de Montr\u00e9al, 6363 Chemin Hudson, Montr\u00e9al, H3S 1M9, CAN"}]},{"given":"Carolina","family":"Bottari","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of Greater Montreal - Institut universitaire sur la r\u00e9adaptation en d\u00e9ficience physique de Montr\u00e9al, 6363 Chemin Hudson, Montr\u00e9al, H3S 1M9, CAN"},{"name":"School of Rehabilitation, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, 7077 Av du Parc, Montr\u00e9al H3N 1X7, CAN"}]},{"given":"Monica","family":"Lavoie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"D\u00e9partement de R\u00e9adaptation, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, QC, Canada;
