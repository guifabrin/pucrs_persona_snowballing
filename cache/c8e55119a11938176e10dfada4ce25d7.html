To effectively exploit these delay variations, we propose\n            <jats:italic>dynamically adaptable resilient pipeline<\/jats:italic>\n            (DARP)\u2014a series of runtime techniques to boost power-performance efficiency and fault tolerance in a pipelined microprocessor. DARP employs early error prediction to avoid a major portion of the timing errors. We combine DARP with the state-of-art\n            <jats:italic>topologically homogeneous and power-performance heterogeneous<\/jats:italic>\n            (THPH) architecture to build up a new frontier for the energy efficiency of multicore processors (DARP-MP). Using a rigorous circuit-architectural infrastructure, we demonstrate that DARP substantially improves the multicore processor performance (9.4--20%) and energy efficiency (10--28.6%) compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The energy-efficiency improvements of DARP-MP are 42% and 49.9% compared against the original THPH and another state-of-art multicore power management scheme, respectively.\n          <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/2755558","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,12,4]],"date-time":"2015-12-04T13:43:07Z","timestamp":1449236587000},"page":"1-21","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"DARP-MP","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"21","author":[{"given":"Hu","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Utah State University, Logan, UT"}]},{"given":"Sanghamitra","family":"Roy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Utah State University, Logan, UT"}]},{"given":"Koushik","family":"Chakraborty","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Utah State University, Logan, UT"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/2024716.2024718"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1629911.1629940"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/JSSC.2008.2007148"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_4_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1629911.1629915"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_5_1","volume-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, (CICC'10)","author":"Chae K."},{"key":"e_1_2_1_6_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/TVLSI.2008.2000248"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_7_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/2463209.2488860"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_8_1","volume-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE\/ACM Design, Automation, and Test in Europe Conference (DATE'11)","author":"Chakraborty K."},{"key":"e_1_2_1_9_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/TVLSI.2012.2199142"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_10_1","volume-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE\/ACM Design, Automation, and Test in Europe Conference (DATE'14)","author":"Chen H."},{"key":"e_1_2_1_11_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/2000064.2000067"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_12_1","volume-title":"Proceedings of the IEEE\/ACM Design, Automation, and Test in Europe Conference (DATE'10)","author":"Choudhury M.
