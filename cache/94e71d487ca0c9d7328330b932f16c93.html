Analyzing these cases, we highlight that \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d is inextricably linked with extrinsic factors that also need addressing, to propose a broadened focus of \u201cwomen\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d as defined through the lens of Martha Nussbaum\u2019s\n            <jats:italic>central human capabilities<\/jats:italic>\n            . Drawing again on our cases, we discuss the importance of taking a long, holistic, and intersectional view to women\u2019s wellbeing. Consolidating lessons learned across studies, we emphasize the potential of framing challenges around women\u2019s health as learning problems, rather than problems of information access alone. Leveraging this perspective, we propose the use of\n            <jats:italic>design-based implementation research<\/jats:italic>\n            as a potential approach in identified learning ecologies, given its emphasis on long-term engagement with multiple stakeholders in the learning process. Although the empirical research we draw from took place in various Indian contexts, we conclude by arguing that key contextual characteristics may translate to other cultures and geographies as well.\n          <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/3397159","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,7]],"date-time":"2020-07-07T12:34:24Z","timestamp":1594125264000},"page":"1-32","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":"Taking the Long, Holistic, and Intersectional View to Women\u2019s Wellbeing","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"27","author":[{"given":"Neha","family":"Kumar","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta"}]},{"given":"Naveena","family":"Karusala","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle"}]},{"given":"Azra","family":"Ismail","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta"}]},{"given":"Anupriya","family":"Tuli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, New Delhi, India"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/2901790.2901873"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/3290607.3299077"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/2556288.2557376"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_4_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/2737856.2737870"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_5_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/2858036.2858187"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_6_1","unstructured":"General Assembly. 2015.
