The lack of privacy is particularly true for popular peer-to-peer data sharing applications such as BitTorrent where user behavior is easily monitored by third parties. Anonymizing overlays such as Tor and Freenet can improve user privacy, but only at a cost of substantially reduced performance. Most users are caught in the middle, unwilling to sacrifice either privacy or performance.<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In this paper, we explore a new design point in this tradeoff between privacy and performance. We describe the design and implementation of a new P2P data sharing protocol, called OneSwarm, that provides users much better privacy than BitTorrent and much better performance than Tor or Freenet. A key aspect of the OneSwarm design is that users have explicit configurable control over the amount of trust they place in peers and in the sharing model for their data: the same data can be shared publicly, anonymously, or with access control, with both trusted and untrusted peers. OneSwarm's novel lookup and transfer techniques yield a median factor of 3.4 improvement in download times relative to Tor and a factor of 6.9 improvement relative to Freenet. OneSwarm is publicly available and has been downloaded by hundreds of thousands of users since its release.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/1851275.1851198","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,10,12]],"date-time":"2012-10-12T20:56:02Z","timestamp":1350075362000},"page":"111-122","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":20,"title":"Privacy-preserving P2P data sharing with OneSwarm","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"40","author":[{"given":"Tomas","family":"Isdal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Michael","family":"Piatek","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Arvind","family":"Krishnamurthy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Thomas","family":"Anderson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","unstructured":"BitTorrent Statistics. http:\/\/www.slyck.com\/story370_BitTorrent_Statistics.
