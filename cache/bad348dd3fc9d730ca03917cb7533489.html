As a practical user modeling method, Persona may accomplish the potential needs data mining effectively based on the analyzing of users. This review mainly focused on how to apply the persona in the exploratory products investigation to acquire useful information from the products design. The method to establish persona and the operating rules were also discussed in this article. The concept of the mobile internet device in future was used as an case to demonstrate the persona mentioned above.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4028\/www.scientific.net\/amr.912-914.1710","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,10]],"date-time":"2014-04-10T15:39:30Z","timestamp":1397144370000},"page":"1710-1713","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Research on Persona-Based User Requirement in the Future Exploratory Products Design","prefix":"10.4028","volume":"912-914","author":[{"given":"Qing","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Northwestern Polytechnical University"}]},{"given":"Sui Huai","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Northwestern Polytechnical University"}]},{"given":"Ming Jiu","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Northwestern Polytechnical University"}]}],"member":"2457","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2014,4]]},"reference":[{"key":"900798","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","unstructured":"Aquino, Plinio T J r , Filgueiras , et al .
