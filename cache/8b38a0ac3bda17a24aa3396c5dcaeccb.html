We argue that there are significant methodological and practical difficulties for personas. It is difficult to determine how many, if any, users are represented by a persona, and thus is difficult to know whether a persona is relevant for intended users. Personas cannot be adequately verified or falsified and therefore have no demonstrable validity. We believe personas are likely to lead to political conflicts and to undermine the ability for researchers to resolve questions with data. We suggest potential research to evaluate the Personas method more thoroughly. Until the methodological issues are resolved, it is best not to consider personas to be a means to communicate data. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/154193120605000503","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,1,19]],"date-time":"2012-01-19T23:33:56Z","timestamp":1327016036000},"page":"634-636","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":78,"title":"The Personas' New Clothes: Methodological and Practical Arguments against a Popular Method","prefix":"10.1177","volume":"50","author":[{"given":"Christopher N.","family":"Chapman","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Microsoft Corporation"},{"name":"Redmond, Washington"}]},{"given":"Russell P.","family":"Milham","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Microsoft Corporation"},{"name":"Redmond, Washington"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,11,6]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr5-154193120605000503","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/978-3-322-99786-9_1"},{"key":"bibr8-154193120605000503","volume-title":"Conjectures and Refutations","author":"Popper K.","year":"1963"},{"key":"bibr9-154193120605000503","volume-title":"The Persona Lifecycle: Keeping People in Mind Throughout Product Design","author":"Pruitt J.","year":"2006"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1177\/154193120605000503","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1177\/154193120605000503","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,10]],"date-time":"2021-06-10T18:14:39Z","timestamp":1623348879000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,10]]},"references-count":3,"journal-issue":{"issue":"5","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2006,10]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1177\/154193120605000503"],"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/154193120605000503","relation":{},"ISSN":["2169-5067","1071-1813"],"container-title-short":"Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting","published":{"date-parts":[[2006,10]]}}
