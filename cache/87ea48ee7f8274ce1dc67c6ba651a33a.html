When user-centered approaches are introduced to teams and organizations, conflict often emerges. Conflict could be dismissed as idiosyncratic differences among team members. In this paper, the authors account for conflicts as a clash of worldview between occupational communities: engineers and UX designers. They define the engineering worldview as the application of science and mathematics to structure sociotechnical processes to solve concrete, pre-specified problems, from an external perspective. By contrast, the UX worldview is a human-centered exploration, through iterative cycles of design and inquiry, of the contingent and context-sensitive ways people mediate activities with technologies and systems. Interpersonal conflict in teams symbolizes a conflict between sharply contrasting ways of seeing the world. By considering the root causes, project managers can productively leverage the expertise of both communities by managing expectations, relations, and artifacts.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/ijskd.2015070101","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,4]],"date-time":"2016-01-04T13:59:51Z","timestamp":1451915991000},"page":"1-19","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"UX as Disruption","prefix":"10.4018","volume":"7","author":[{"given":"Emma J.","family":"Rose","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington Tacoma, Tacoma, WA, USA"}]},{"given":"Josh","family":"Tenenberg","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Washington Tacoma, Tacoma, WA, USA"}]}],"member":"2432","container-title":"International Journal of Sociotechnology and Knowledge Development","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.igi-global.com\/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=142957","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,21]],"date-time":"2018-11-21T01:35:31Z","timestamp":1542764131000},"score":1,"subtitle":["Managing Team Conflict as a Productive Resource"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3"},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4018\/IJSKD.2015070101","relation":{},"ISSN":["1941-6253","1941-6261"],"subject":["Information Systems and Management","Computer Science Applications"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]}}
