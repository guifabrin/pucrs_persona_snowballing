Such integration may lead to a more efficient design procedure and ultimately to a more accurate representation of the business process. However, active involvement of process participants creates several challenges, as the latter are not expected to have modeling skills. The purpose of this paper is to present a business process design approach, called CoMPArE \/WP, which tightly integrates the elicitation and modeling stages of process design, through the active involvement of process participants. To achieve effective involvement of process participants, CoMPArE\/WP adopts the principles of natural modeling. However, being a business process design approach aiming at supporting the whole BPM lifecycle, CoMPArE \/WP deals also with the transition of natural modeling to formal process representations that can be enacted using a BPMS.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/ijismd.2016040101","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,9]],"date-time":"2016-08-09T14:03:54Z","timestamp":1470751434000},"page":"1-30","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":"Linking Natural Modeling to Techno-centric Modeling for the Active Involvement of Process Participants in Business Process Design","prefix":"10.4018","volume":"7","author":[{"given":"Stefan","family":"Oppl","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Johannes Kepler University of Linz, Linz, Austria"}]},{"given":"Nancy","family":"Alexopoulou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Johannes Kepler University of Linz, Linz, Austria"}]}],"member":"2432","container-title":"International Journal of Information System Modeling and Design","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.igi-global.com\/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=162694","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]],"date-time":"2020-06-23T20:25:18Z","timestamp":1592943918000},"score":1,"subtitle":[""],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,4]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2"},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4018\/IJISMD.2016040101","relation":{},"ISSN":["1947-8186","1947-8194"],"subject":["Management of Technology and Innovation","Information Systems"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2016,4]]}}
