We explore personality design in a non-anthropomorphic voice-assisted home robot. Our design approach developed three distinct robot personas: Butler, Buddy, and Sidekick, intended to differ in proactivity and emotional impact. Persona differences were signaled to users by a combination of humanoid (speech, intonation), and indirect cues (colors and movement). We use Big Five personality theory to evaluate perceived differences between personas in an exploratory Wizard of Oz study. Participants were largely able to recognize underlying personality traits expressed through these cue combinations in ways that were consistent with our design goals. The proactive Buddy persona was judged as more Extravert than the more passive Sidekick persona, and the Butler persona was perceived as more Conscientious and less Neurotic than either Buddy or Butler personas. Users also had clear preferences between different personas; they wanted robots that mimicked but accentuated their own personality. Results suggest that future designs might exploit abstract cues to signal personality traits.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/3424153","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,20]],"date-time":"2021-02-20T22:20:41Z","timestamp":1613859641000},"page":"1-25","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":"Designing Personas for Expressive Robots","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"10","author":[{"given":"Steve","family":"Whittaker","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of California at Santa Cruz, CA, USA"}]},{"given":"Yvonne","family":"Rogers","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University College London, London, UK"}]},{"given":"Elena","family":"Petrovskaya","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University College London, London, UK"}]},{"given":"Hongbin","family":"Zhuang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Emotech, London, UK, UK"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","volume-title":"2018 27th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN\u201918)","author":"Anderson-Bashan Lucy"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/2702123.2702592"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.5555\/2790855.2790859"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_4_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/ROMAN.2004.1374827"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_5_1","volume-title":"INTERSPEECH","author":"Bellegarda Jerome R.","year":"2013"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_6_1","volume-title":"2010 IEEE 9th International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL\u201910)","author":"Emily"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_8_1","volume-title":"Designing Sociable Robots","author":"Breazeal Cynthia"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_9_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1146\/annurev-psych-010416-043958"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_10_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/088395199117360"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_11_1","volume-title":"11th ACM\/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI\u201916)","author":"Jessica"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_12_1","volume-title":"Corr and Gerald Matthews","author":"Philip","year":"2009"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_13_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1093\/geronj\/31.5.564"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_14_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/301136.301237"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_15_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/IROS.2005.1545189"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_16_1","volume-title":"AAAI Fall Symposium.","author":"Dryer Christopher","year":"1997"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_17_1","volume-title":"Human Robot Interaction Conference.","author":"Erel Hadas","year":"2018"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_18_1","first-page":"3","article-title":"A survey of socially interactive robots","volume":"42","author":"Fong Terrence","year":"2003","journal-title":"Rob.
