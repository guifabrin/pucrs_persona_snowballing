The results of this ethnographic study suggest that although these technical communicators were well acquainted with user-centered design (UCD) concepts and claimed to actively practice UCD, their appeals often did not reference data collected within user-centered research and instead referenced designer-centric appeals to support their claims. This group\u2019s overall use of appeals to support their design decisions suggests that more empirical study into UCD theory and practice as well as students\u2019 argumentation skills is warranted.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/1050651910371197","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,13]],"date-time":"2010-09-13T12:23:22Z","timestamp":1284380602000},"page":"403-444","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":"Designing From Data: Rhetorical Appeals in Support of Design Decisions","prefix":"10.1177","volume":"24","author":[{"given":"Erin","family":"Friess","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of North Texas, Denton, TX, USA,"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2010,8,23]]},"reference":[{"key":"atypb1","volume-title":"About STC","year":"2007"},{"key":"atypb2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00163-002-0023-z"},{"key":"atypb3","volume-title":"AIGA\/Aquent Survey of Design Salaries 2006","author":"Aiga.","year":"2006"},{"key":"atypb4","first-page":"72","volume":"3","author":"Allen, M.","year":"1997","journal-title":"Communication Theory"},{"key":"atypb5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1207\/s15427625tcq1302_3"},{"key":"atypb6","volume-title":"Technical communication: A reader-centered approach","author":"Anderson, P.V.","year":"2007","edition":"6"},{"key":"atypb7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/TPC.1981.6447819"},{"key":"atypb8","first-page":"21","volume":"22","author":"Atlas, M.","year":"1998","journal-title":"Journal of Computer Documentation"},{"key":"atypb9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/00223980.1956.9713040"},{"key":"atypb10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/00028533.1997.11978016"},{"key":"atypb11","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/009365094021005002"},{"key":"atypb12","volume-title":"Usability testing and research","author":"Barnum, C.M.","year":"2002"},{"key":"atypb13","volume-title":"Narratives in popular culture, media, and everyday life","author":"Berger, A.A.","year":"1997"},{"key":"atypb14","volume-title":"\u2018\u2018User-centered\u2019\u2019 is so pass\u00e9.
