We provide a survey of relevant concepts from the A-life and new media research communities, and we establish threads of commonalities with the HCI research community and especially the subset of that community that emphasizes aspects of user experience other than those that are characterized by performance-based measures. We describe and discuss several exemplar A-life artworks that are drawn from the last decade of jury selections of the annual Vida Art and Artificial Life Competition, conducted by Fundaci\u00f3n Telefonica. We conclude with a discussion of issues that are common to the A-life and HCI research communities.\n          <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/1453152.1453154","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,10]],"date-time":"2008-12-10T15:32:31Z","timestamp":1228923151000},"page":"1-27","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":"The aesthetics of emergence","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"15","author":[{"given":"Melanie","family":"Baljko","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"}]},{"given":"Nell","family":"Tenhaaf","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","volume-title":"Proceedings of AAAI","author":"Baljko M.","year":"2006"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/345513.345267"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1165734.1165737"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_4_1","volume-title":"Proceedings of Advanced Computer Entertainment (ACE)","author":"Benford S."},{"key":"e_1_2_1_5_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1070960.1070990"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_6_1","volume-title":"Proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Computational Semiotics for Games and New Media (COSIGN)","author":"B\u00f6hlen M."},{"key":"e_1_2_1_7_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162\/lmj.2005.15.1.45"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_8_1","volume-title":"Emergence and Artificial Life","author":"Cariani P."},{"key":"e_1_2_1_9_1","volume-title":"Using Language","author":"Clark H.
