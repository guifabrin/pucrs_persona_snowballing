They are used by commuters as a complement to public transport. Despite the increasing popularity, the current market offer of folding bikes still represents quite some restrictions and downsides which decrease their usability. This paper shows a user-centred process of designing and prototyping a composite folding bike with the aim of improving the user experience of folding bike using commuters. By improving the usability and ease of use of folding bikes, their full potential can be unlocked. The design process led to a disruptive folding bike design with front and rear single-sided offset wheel mounting. The concept excels in its intuitive and quick folding mechanism, superior riding performance and comfort, adjustability and overall ease of use. In addition to the design process and prototyping of the folding bike, this extended abstract elaborates on the performed user tests and its results. These tests range from the impact of offset wheels to the intuitiveness of the folding mechanism and were performed in order to prove different aspects of the design. This research shows how rethinking and redesigning a bike concept (product) from scratch, using a user-centred design process and taking into account the three aspects \u2014 business, technology and people \u2014 can lead to a disruptive design that improves usability and the overall user experience of the stakeholders.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1051\/matecconf\/201816701001","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,23]],"date-time":"2018-04-23T07:50:14Z","timestamp":1524469814000},"page":"01001","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"The design of a composite folding bike to improve the user experience of commuters","prefix":"10.1051","volume":"167","author":[{"given":"Thomas","family":"Vervisch","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yannick","family":"Christiaens","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jan","family":"Detand","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"250","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,23]]},"reference":[{"key":"R1","unstructured":"The Folding Cyclist, \u201cFolding Bike News,\u201d (2017).
