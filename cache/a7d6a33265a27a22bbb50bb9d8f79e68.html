Outstanding security requirements arising from this means of data storage and management include data security and privacy. Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) is an efficient encryption system with fine-grained access control for encrypting out-sourced data in cloud computing. Since data outsourcing systems require flexible access control approach Problems arises when sharing confidential corporate data in cloud computing. User-Identity needs to be managed globally and access policies can be defined by several authorities. Data is dual encrypted for more security and to maintain De-Centralization in Multi-Authority environment.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.32628\/cseit19518","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,12]],"date-time":"2019-01-12T05:21:43Z","timestamp":1547270503000},"page":"57-61","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Improvement of Privacy and Security in Hybrid Cloud with Attribute Group Based Access Control","prefix":"10.32628","author":[{"given":"Kayalvili","family":"S","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Computer Science and Engineering, Velalar College of Engineering and Technology, Erode, Tamilnadu, India"}]},{"given":"Sowmitha","family":"V","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"ME-CSE, Velalar College of Engineering and Technology, Erode, Tamilnadu, India"}]}],"member":"17802","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref0","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","unstructured":"S.
