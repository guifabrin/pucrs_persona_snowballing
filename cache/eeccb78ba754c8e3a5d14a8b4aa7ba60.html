In this paper I show how the creators of popular films including science consultants construct cinematic representations of technological possibilities as a means by which to overcome these obstacles and stimulate a desire in audiences to see potential technologies become realities. This paper focuses specifically on the production process in order to show how entertainment producers construct cinematic scenarios with an eye towards generating real-world funding opportunities and the ability to construct real-life prototypes. I introduce the term \u2018diegetic prototypes\u2019 to account for the ways in which cinematic depictions of future technologies demonstrate to large public audiences a technology\u2019s need, viability and benevolence. Entertainment producers create diegetic prototypes by influencing dialogue, plot rationalizations, character interactions and narrative structure. These technologies only exist in the fictional world \u2014 what film scholars call the diegesis \u2014 but they exist as fully functioning objects in that world. The essay builds upon previous work on the notion of prototypes as \u2018performative artefacts\u2019. The performative aspects of prototypes are especially evident in diegetic prototypes because a film\u2019s narrative structure contextualizes technologies within the social sphere. Technological objects in cinema are at once both completely artificial \u2014 all aspects of their depiction are controlled in production \u2014 and normalized within the text as practical objects that function properly and which people actually use as everyday objects. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/0306312709338325","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2009,10,1]],"date-time":"2009-10-01T01:14:50Z","timestamp":1254359690000},"page":"41-70","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":123,"title":"The Future is Now","prefix":"10.1177","volume":"40","author":[{"given":"David","family":"Kirby","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Manchester, UK,"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2009,9,30]]},"reference":[{"key":"atypb1","first-page":"10","author":"Anonymous","year":"1931","journal-title":"New York Times"},{"key":"atypb2","first-page":"1","author":"Anonymous","year":"1954","journal-title":"New York Times"},{"key":"atypb3","volume-title":"Goals in Space: American Values and the Future of Technology","author":"Bainbridge, William S.","year":"1991"},{"key":"atypb4","unstructured":"Billings, Linda ( 2007) \u2018Overview: Ideology, Advocacy, and Spaceflight - Evolution of a Cultural Narrative\u2019, in S.J.
