Because failures during updates may destroy transient data (e.g., in CPU registers), preserving data integrity in the presence of failures requires failure-atomic bundles of updates. Prior failure atomicity approaches for persistent memory entail overheads due to logging and CPU cache flushing. Persistent caches can eliminate the need for flushing, but conventional logging remains complex and memory intensive. We present the design and implementation of JUSTDO logging, a new failure atomicity mechanism that greatly reduces the memory footprint of logs, simplifies log management, and enables fast parallel recovery following failure. Crash-injection tests confirm that JUSTDO logging preserves application data integrity and performance evaluations show that it improves throughput 3x or more compared with a state-of-the-art alternative for a spectrum of data-intensive algorithms.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/2954679.2872410","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,10]],"date-time":"2016-06-10T13:54:00Z","timestamp":1465566840000},"page":"427-442","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":"Failure-Atomic Persistent Memory Updates via JUSTDO Logging","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"51","author":[{"given":"Joseph","family":"Izraelevitz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"}]},{"given":"Terence","family":"Kelly","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Hewlett Packard Labs, Palo Alto, CA, USA"}]},{"given":"Aasheesh","family":"Kolli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","volume-title":"29 No.","author":"Sarita","year":"1996"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","volume-title":"Spring Joint Computer Conference","author":"Amdahl Gene M.","year":"1967"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Dmytro Apalkov Alexey Khvalkovskiy Steven Watts Valdimir Nikitin Xueti Tang Daniel Lottis Kiseok Moon Xiao Luo Eugene Chen Adrian Ong Alexander Driskill-Smith and Mohamad Krounbi. \"Spin-transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM).\" In Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems (JETC)--Special issue on memory technologies 2013.
