This inspired look at the future of creating complex software explores the shift from programming environments to design environments, discussing environments that help developers satisfy end-users' cognitive needs and help deal with contextual issues such as the aesthetic, practical, and social properties of the application and the users. A strong case is made that design environments will need to provide robust support for communication between developers and end users.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/203241.203259","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2002,7,27]],"date-time":"2002-07-27T11:32:13Z","timestamp":1027769533000},"page":"65-74","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":44,"title":"From programming environments to environments for designing","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"38","author":[{"given":"Terry","family":"Winograd","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Stanford University Department of Computer Science, Stanford, CA"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_2","volume-title":"Oxford","author":"Adler P.","year":"1992"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_2","unstructured":"Apple Computer.
