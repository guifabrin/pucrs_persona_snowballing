A variety of methodologies grouped by the term Human-Centred Design (HCD) have been deployed to formalise and improve this process, ranging from user-centred to participatory practices. However, the approaches\u2019 consideration is primarily limited to individuals in their respective space and time.<\/jats:p><jats:p>To examine these system boundaries in detail and address potentials for adaptation, this paper reviews dominant HCD methodologies, categorises them and highlights their respective characteristics. Further, concepts and methodologies from related fields are studied for potential contributions to HCD. This results in a proposed re-definition of the system boundaries of HCD by integrating spatio-temporal impacts on humans through an extended social, environmental and economic scope.<\/jats:p><jats:p>The different studied approaches and varying impact assessments are exemplarily applied to the case study of urban mobility, in particular human-centred, scenario-based design approaches. However, the described methods and concepts are kept generic to ensure the applicability across various domains of design practice.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/pds.2021.513","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,4]],"date-time":"2021-08-04T09:59:52Z","timestamp":1628071192000},"page":"2521-2530","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"RE-DEFINING THE SYSTEM BOUNDARIES OF HUMAN-CENTRED DESIGN","prefix":"10.1017","volume":"1","author":[{"given":"Tjark","family":"Gall","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Flore","family":"Vallet","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Sylvie","family":"Douzou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bernard","family":"Yannou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,27]]},"reference":[{"key":"S2732527X21005137_ref7238","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1038\/srep20281"},{"key":"S2732527X21005137_ref7282","article-title":"A Probabilistic Approach to the Forecasting of Upstream-Government Take on Crude Oil Exports: 1970-1985","volume":"52","author":"Planning","year":"1971","journal-title":"PL\/"},{"key":"S2732527X21005137_ref7256","first-page":"62","article-title":"Scandinavian Approaches to Participatory Design","volume":"19\/1","author":"Gregory","year":"2003","journal-title":"International Journal on Engineering Education"},{"key":"S2732527X21005137_ref7291","first-page":"1","article-title":"Tangible futures: Combining scenario thinking and personas - A pilot study on urban mobility","volume":"117\/102513","author":"Vallet","year":"2020","journal-title":"Futures"},{"key":"S2732527X21005137_ref7251","first-page":"1","article-title":"Extracting scenario archetypes: A quantitative text analysis of documents about the future","volume":"1\/2","author":"Fergnani","year":"2019","journal-title":"Future and Foresight Science"},{"key":"S2732527X21005137_ref7248","first-page":"1","article-title":"A comprehensive scenario intervention typology","volume":"149\/119748","author":"Crawford","year":"2019","journal-title":"Technological Forecasting and Societal Change"},{"key":"S2732527X21005137_ref7240","unstructured":"Bigo, A.
