The purpose of this paper is to examine the results of three studies to derive key factors during the development and engineering process of care and support systems for older people that can impact acceptance and uptake to provide support to future projects.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design\/methodology\/approach<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The paper analyzed the results of three qualitative studies, including two detailed case studies and a further study with 35 participants, to derive key factors. Methods for deriving factors are based on thematic analysis to identify common factors across cases and participants.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The findings point to a broad set of interconnected factors that give developers of these types of systems specific recommendations. These highlight what makes these projects complex and identify implications for the development process. Furthermore, they show way the needed user-centered and iterative methods may be in conflict with funding processes.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality\/value<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>While others have reported on single projects or looked at acceptance, these studies were the first to explore aspects of the development process that may contribute to the lack of success to date of these types of systems. The results here support more successful outcomes in the future, both by helping people involved in the development of these systems to avoid some of the issues others face and providing input to improve the performance of the engineering process.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1108\/jet-12-2017-0053","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,10]],"date-time":"2018-10-10T11:05:11Z","timestamp":1539169511000},"page":"186-196","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Key factors in the engineering process for systems for aging in place contributing to low usability and success","prefix":"10.1108","volume":"12","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6305-4474","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jean D.","family":"Hallewell Haslwanter","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Geraldine","family":"Fitzpatrick","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Klaus","family":"Miesenberger","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"140","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,10,10]]},"reference":[{"key":"key2021041507591115900_ref001","first-page":"197","article-title":"Personas in action: ethnography in an interaction design team","year":"2002"},{"issue":"6","key":"key2021041507591115900_ref002","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"672","DOI":"10.1016\/j.intcom.2005.09.005","article-title":"Socially dependable design: the challenge of ageing populations for HCI","volume":"17","year":"2005","journal-title":"Interacting Computer"},{"key":"key2021041507591115900_ref003","volume-title":"Successful Qualitative Research","year":"2013"},{"key":"key2021041507591115900_ref004","volume-title":"Final Evaluation of the AAL-JP","year":"2013"},{"key":"key2021041507591115900_ref005","first-page":"f653","article-title":"Effect of telehealth on quality of life and psychological outcomes over 12 months","volume":"346","year":"2013","journal-title":"BMJ"},{"issue":"5","key":"key2021041507591115900_ref006","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"598","DOI":"10.1093\/iwc\/iwv036","article-title":"Stakeholder attitudes toward and values embedded in a sensor-enhanced personal emergency response system","volume":"28","year":"2016","journal-title":"Interacting with Computers"},{"issue":"3-4","key":"key2021041507591115900_ref007","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"272","DOI":"10.3109\/17538157.2014.931853","article-title":"A technical platform for environments for ageing \u2013 lessons learned from three field studies","volume":"39","year":"2014","journal-title":"Informatics for Health Social Care"},{"key":"key2021041507591115900_ref008","volume-title":"The Demographic Future of Europe \u2013 From Challenge to Opportunity","author":"European Commission","year":"2006"},{"issue":"4","key":"key2021041507591115900_ref009","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2012-001574","article-title":"The organising vision for telehealth and telecare: discourse analysis","volume":"2","year":"2012","journal-title":"BMJ Open"},{"key":"key2021041507591115900_ref010","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"86","DOI":"10.1016\/j.socscimed.2013.05.036","article-title":"What matters to older people with assisted living needs?","volume":"93","year":"2013","journal-title":"Social Science & Medicine"},{"key":"key2021041507591115900_ref011","first-page":"90","article-title":"Designing for dynamic diversity: making accessible interfaces for older people","year":"2001"},{"key":"key2021041507591115900_ref012","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Gr\u00fcnloh, C., Walldius, \u00c5., Hartmann, G. and Gulliksen, J.
