A better understanding of diagnostic processes is needed to mitigate errors. This paper describes a study protocol to map diagnostic processes in the ED as a foundation for developing future error mitigation strategies.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods and analysis<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study of an adult and a paediatric academic ED uses a prospective mixed methods case study design informed by an ED-specific diagnostic decision-making model (the modified ED-National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) model) and two cognitive theories (dual process theory and distributed cognition). Data sources include audio recordings of patient and care team interactions, electronic health record data, observer field notes and stakeholder interviews. Multiple qualitative analysis methods will be used to explore diagnostic processes in situ, including systems information flow, human\u2013human and human\u2013system interactions and contextual factors influencing cognition. The study has three parts. Part 1 involves prospective field observations of patients with undifferentiated symptoms at high risk for diagnostic error, where each patient is followed throughout the entire care delivery process. Part 2 involves observing individual care team providers over a 4-hour window to capture their diagnostic workflow, team coordination and communication across multiple patients. Part 3 uses interviews with key stakeholders to understand different perspectives on the diagnostic process, as well as perceived strengths and vulnerabilities, in order to enrich the ED-NASEM diagnostic model.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Ethics and dissemination<\/jats:title><jats:p>The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approved this study, HUM00156261. This foundational work will help identify strengths and vulnerabilities in diagnostic processes. Further, it will inform the future development and testing of patient, provider and systems-level interventions for mitigating error and improving patient safety in these and other EDs. The work will be disseminated through journal publications and presentations at national and international meetings.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1136\/bmjopen-2020-044194","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,24]],"date-time":"2021-09-24T16:57:45Z","timestamp":1632502665000},"page":"e044194","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1136\/crossmarkpolicy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Understanding diagnostic processes in emergency departments: a mixed methods case study protocol","prefix":"10.1136","volume":"11","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8961-7119","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Michelle","family":"Daniel","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"SunYoung","family":"Park","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Colleen M","family":"Seifert","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"P Paul","family":"Chandanabhumma","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Michael D","family":"Fetters","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eric","family":"Wilson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Andrew B","family":"Canvasser","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hardeep","family":"Singh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kalyan","family":"Pasupathy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Prashant","family":"Mahajan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"239","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,24]]},"reference":[{"key":"2021102703400438000_11.9.e044194.1","first-page":"99","article-title":"Editorial: helping health care organizations to define diagnostic errors as missed opportunities in diagnosis","volume":"40","author":"Singh","year":"2014","journal-title":"Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf"},{"key":"2021102703400438000_11.9.e044194.2","unstructured":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
