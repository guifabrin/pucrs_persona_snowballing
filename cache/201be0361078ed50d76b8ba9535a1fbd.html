We suggest there needs to be much more integration between Computer Science and HCI. We believe this can be brought about by adopting HCI as the underlying principle to the development of systems. Usability engineering would provide the necessary framework for the development of usable systems.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/353519.343076","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2004,7,21]],"date-time":"2004-07-21T22:43:36Z","timestamp":1090449816000},"page":"61-64","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":"Enter the usability engineer","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"32","author":[{"given":"Xristine","family":"Faulkner","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"South Bank University, London SE1 0AA"}]},{"given":"Fintan","family":"Culwin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"South Bank University, London SE1 0AA"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_2","unstructured":"ACM SIGCHI 'Curricula for Human-Computer Interaction'.
