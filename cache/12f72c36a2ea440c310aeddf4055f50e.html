The authors will approach SandS from the user's perspective and illustrate how users and their relationships can be modeled through a number of fuzzy stereotypical profiles. Additionally, context modeling in pervasive computing systems and especially in the Smart Home paradigm will be examined through appropriate representation of context cues in the overall interaction. Finally, the authors will investigate how users and system services although using languages of different semantic expressiveness can inter-operate successfully thanks to appropriate knowledge-based expert mappings.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/ijvcsn.2015070102","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,4,7]],"date-time":"2016-04-07T11:57:49Z","timestamp":1460030269000},"page":"17-50","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Context-Aware User Modeling and Semantic Interoperability in Smart Home Environments","prefix":"10.4018","volume":"7","author":[{"given":"Giorgos","family":"Siolas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Intelligent Systems, Content and Interaction Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"}]},{"given":"George","family":"Caridakis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Intelligent Systems, Content and Interaction Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens, Athens and Department of Cultural Technology and Communication, University of the Aegean, Mytilene, Greece"}]},{"given":"Phivos","family":"Mylonas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Intelligent Systems, Content and Interaction Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens, Athens and Department of Informatics, Ionian University, Corfu, Greece"}]},{"given":"Giorgos","family":"Stratogiannis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Intelligent Systems, Content and Interaction Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"}]},{"given":"Stefanos","family":"Kollias","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Intelligent Systems, Content and Interaction Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"}]},{"given":"Andreas","family":"Stafylopatis","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Intelligent Systems, Content and Interaction Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"}]}],"member":"2432","container-title":"International Journal of Virtual Communities and Social Networking","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.igi-global.com\/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=149471","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,23]],"date-time":"2020-06-23T20:02:16Z","timestamp":1592942536000},"score":1,"subtitle":[""],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3"},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4018\/IJVCSN.2015070102","relation":{},"ISSN":["1942-9010","1942-9029"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2015,7]]}}
