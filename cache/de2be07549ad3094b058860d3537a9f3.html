The reason is the lack of effective modelling, computational algorithms, and resultant evaluations in quantitative research. In this article, the authors take social media into consideration and link users together under the umbrella of social networks so as to exploit a way that the potential problems related to media privacy could be solved. The author's contributions are to propose tensor product-based progressive scrambling approaches for privacy preservation of social media and apply our approaches to the given social media which may encapsulate privacy before being viewed so as to achieve the goal of privacy preservation in anonymity, diverse and closeness. These approaches fully preserve the media information of the scrambled image and make sure it is able to be restored. The results show the proposed privacy persevering approaches are effective and have outstanding performance in media privacy preservation.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/ijdcf.2018040104","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,28]],"date-time":"2018-02-28T10:22:43Z","timestamp":1519813363000},"page":"56-73","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Progressive Scrambling for Social Media","prefix":"10.4018","volume":"10","author":[{"given":"Wei Qi","family":"Yan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand"}]},{"given":"Xiaotian","family":"Wu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Computer Science, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China, and State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"}]},{"given":"Feng","family":"Liu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering and School of Cybersecurity University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, China"}]}],"member":"2432","container-title":"International Journal of Digital Crime and Forensics","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.igi-global.com\/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=201536","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,11,13]],"date-time":"2018-11-13T01:36:13Z","timestamp":1542072973000},"score":1,"subtitle":[""],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"2"},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4018\/IJDCF.2018040104","relation":{},"ISSN":["1941-6210","1941-6229"],"subject":["Software"],"published":{"date-parts":[[2018,4]]}}
