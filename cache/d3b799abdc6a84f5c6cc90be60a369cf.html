The remote access of the data brings the issue of trust. Despite the use of strong encryption schemes, adversaries can still learn valuable information regarding encrypted data by observing the data access patterns. To that end, one can hide the access patterns, which may leak sensitive information, using Oblivious RAMs (ORAMs). Numerous works have proposed different ORAM constructions, but they have never been thoroughly compared against and tested on large databases. There are also no open source implementation of these schemes.<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>These limitations make it difficult for researchers and practitioners to choose and adopt a suitable ORAM for their applications. To address this issue, we provide a thorough study over several practical ORAM constructions, and implement them under the same library. We perform extensive experiments to provide insights into their performance characteristics with respect to efficiency, scalability, and communication cost.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.14778\/2994509.2994528","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,9,6]],"date-time":"2016-09-06T15:27:03Z","timestamp":1473175623000},"page":"1113-1124","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":20,"title":"Oblivious RAM","prefix":"10.14778","volume":"9","author":[{"given":"Zhao","family":"Chang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Utah"}]},{"given":"Dong","family":"Xie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Utah"}]},{"given":"Feifei","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Utah"}]}],"member":"5777","container-title":"Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/dl.acm.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.14778\/2994509.2994528","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,7]],"date-time":"2021-08-07T05:10:04Z","timestamp":1628313004000},"score":1,"subtitle":["a dissection and experimental evaluation"],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]},"references-count":37,"journal-issue":{"issue":"12","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2016,8]]}},"alternative-id":["10.14778\/2994509.2994528"],"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.14778\/2994509.2994528","relation":{},"ISSN":["2150-8097"],"container-title-short":"Proc.
