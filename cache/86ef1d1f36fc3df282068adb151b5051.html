Based on this problem, a privacy protection scheme for social networks based on classified attribute encryption (PPSSN) is proposed for the data owner and attribute management server to manage user permissions; the approach reduces data owner overhead and also avoids use of a property management server to limit access user collusion attacks. To balance the privacy and security of data publication, this scheme classifies users and designs access control for different users and different privileges. In addition, this paper also introduces a good friend data cache mechanism to improve and optimize the original scheme to reduce the cost of decryption. The efficiency and system overhead of the proposed scheme are compared and analyzed based on experiments. The experiments show that the proposed scheme improves query efficiency, reduces system cost, and enhances privacy security.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/9108759","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,27]],"date-time":"2019-09-27T00:05:41Z","timestamp":1569542741000},"page":"1-14","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Privacy Protection of Social Networks Based on Classified Attribute Encryption","prefix":"10.1155","volume":"2019","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9350-5961","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Lin","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210003, China"},{"name":"Department of Computer Science, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA"},{"name":"Jiangsu High Technology Research Key Laboratory for Wireless Sensor Networks, Nanjing 210003, China"}]},{"given":"Li","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210003, China"}]},{"given":"Eric","family":"Medwedeff","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Computer Science, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA 92182, USA"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4392-3599","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Haiping","family":"Huang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210003, China"},{"name":"Jiangsu High Technology Research Key Laboratory for Wireless Sensor Networks, Nanjing 210003, China"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5454-210X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Xiong","family":"Fu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210003, China"},{"name":"Jiangsu High Technology Research Key Laboratory for Wireless Sensor Networks, Nanjing 210003, China"}]},{"given":"Ruchuan","family":"Wang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"College of Computer, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing 210003, China"},{"name":"Jiangsu High Technology Research Key Laboratory for Wireless Sensor Networks, Nanjing 210003, China"}]}],"member":"98","reference":[{"issue":"8","key":"1","first-page":"23","volume":"35","year":"2014","journal-title":"Journal of Communication"},{"key":"2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/tsc.2015.2478453"},{"key":"3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s11280-017-0490-9"},{"key":"4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s11280-017-0461-1"},{"key":"5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s11280-017-0455-z"},{"key":"6","first-page":"1","volume":"11","year":"2017","journal-title":"World Wide Web-Internet & Web Information Systems"},{"key":"7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/3-540-39568-7_5"},{"key":"8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/3-540-44647-8_13"},{"key":"9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/11426639_27"},{"issue":"10","key":"15","first-page":"2256","volume":"55","year":"2014","journal-title":"IPSJ Journal"},{"key":"16","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/tifs.2014.2363562"},{"issue":"s1","key":"21","first-page":"224","volume":"37","year":"2016","journal-title":"Journal of Communication"},{"issue":"8","key":"22","first-page":"116","volume":"35","year":"2014","journal-title":"Journal of Communication"},{"issue":"10","key":"24","first-page":"181","volume":"114","year":"2015","journal-title":"IEICE Technical Report Information & Communication System Security"}],"container-title":"Security and Communication Networks","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/scn\/2019\/9108759.pdf","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/scn\/2019\/9108759.xml","content-type":"application\/xml","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/downloads.hindawi.com\/journals\/scn\/2019\/9108759.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,27]],"date-time":"2019-09-27T00:05:48Z","timestamp":1569542748000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,26]]},"references-count":14,"alternative-id":["9108759","9108759"],"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1155\/2019\/9108759","relation":{},"ISSN":["1939-0114","1939-0122"],"subject":["Computer Networks and Communications","Information Systems"],"container-title-short":"Security and Communication Networks","published":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,26]]}}
