At certain points in the process, there is a need for design representations that (1) explore the intended use situation in some detail, and still (2) appear tentative enough to afford participation and engagement by intended users and other stakeholders. The designer's task is often to create ideas on the not-yet-existing. The envisioned use situations increasingly involve complicated technology, mobile use and demanding physical environments. Under these conditions, a third requirement on the representation technique is that it (3) allows for expression of ideas and use situations that would be impractical or impossible to create in conventional prototyping techniques. (An obvious example is the observation that lo-fi paper prototypes are of limited use for virtual reality design.)<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/1029036.1029048","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2005,1,26]],"date-time":"2005-01-26T16:35:53Z","timestamp":1106757353000},"page":"22-27","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":"Animated use sketches as design representations","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"11","author":[{"given":"Jonas","family":"L\u00f6wgren","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Malmo University"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","volume-title":"V\u00e4xj\u00f6","author":"Att","year":"2003"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/641007.641147"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/347642.347802"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_4_1","first-page":"19","volume-title":"Building tomorrow today (Proc. i3 Annual Conference)","author":"L\u00f6wgren J.","year":"2000"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_5_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/347642.347666"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_6_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/174630.174633"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_7_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/312683.312715"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_8_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/70609.70615"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_9_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1125021.1125047"}],"container-title":"Interactions","original-title":[],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/dl.acm.org\/doi\/pdf\/10.1145\/1029036.1029048","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,20]],"date-time":"2021-02-20T06:36:00Z","timestamp":1613802960000},"score":1,"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2004,11]]},"references-count":9,"journal-issue":{"issue":"6","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2004,11]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1145\/1029036.1029048"],"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1145\/1029036.1029048","relation":{},"ISSN":["1072-5520","1558-3449"],"subject":["Human-Computer Interaction"],"container-title-short":"interactions","published":{"date-parts":[[2004,11]]}}
