In South Africa, the National Health Insurance system has been endorsed as a funding model for the provision of universal health coverage for South Africans. Community Health Workers have contributed to better universal health coverage outcomes in many countries. A study in India revealed that coverage of health care practices is positively correlated with the knowledge level of Community Health Workers. In South Africa, there is a difference in the duration of training of Community Health Workers in different provinces, especially in Vhembe District.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Objective:<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study aimed to assess Community Health Workers\u2019 knowledge regarding their roles and describe their challenges within the context of National Health Insurance.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods:<\/jats:title><jats:p>Qualitative design was used to collect data from 33 participants who formed five focus groups comprising six to eight members each.
