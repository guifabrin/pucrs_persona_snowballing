Researchers joined development projects for approximately one month and participated in interface design while concurrently interviewing other project participants and employees, recording activity in meetings and on electronic networks, and otherwise observing the process. The two organizations differed in their approaches to development, and, in each case, the approach differed in practice from the model supported by the organizational structure. Development practices blocked the successful application of accepted principles of interface design. The obstacles to effective design that results from people noticing and being affected by interface changes, and a lack of communication among those sharing responsibility for different aspects of the interface.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/174630.174633","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2002,7,27]],"date-time":"2002-07-27T11:26:13Z","timestamp":1027769173000},"page":"52-80","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":58,"title":"Organizational obstacles to interface design and development","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"1","author":[{"given":"Steven E.","family":"Poltrock","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Boeing Corporation"}]},{"given":"Jonathan","family":"Grudin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of California, Irvine"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","unstructured":"ALLEN T.J. 1977.
