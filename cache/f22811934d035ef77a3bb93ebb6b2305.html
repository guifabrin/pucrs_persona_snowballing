Analyzing the cases with these factors reveals that technicians who collect good quality data have received good training and instructions for the CMMS, are competent, and understand how manually collected data benefits them in their own work. However, even these sites struggle with the usability of the CMMS.<\/jats:p>\n<\/jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations\/implications<\/jats:title>\n<jats:p>The 17 TOP factors and the criteria for CMMS evaluation extend understanding on context and usability in manual data collection.
