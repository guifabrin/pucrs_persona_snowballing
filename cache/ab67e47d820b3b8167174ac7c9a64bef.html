Their role as a novel approach to reduce the distance between students and knowledge is also well documented. In this chapter, we will describe a multi-disciplinary approach to designing a particular class of educational games: business management games. We argue that through a better understanding of the relationship between work-domain based decisions and processes, professional game designers can achieve effective results. The design approach was based on intensive collaboration and co-design meetings with business management researchers and professors. The result was a game called \u201cSimCompany\u201d, aimed at teaching children about business management concepts, thus promoting an entrepreneurship culture in classroom settings. \u201cSimCompany\u201d proved effective as a teaching tool about business management concepts, and initial evaluation showed a positive increase in students\u2019 rate of learning, when compared to traditional teaching methods.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4018\/978-1-60960-569-8.ch009","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,5,25]],"date-time":"2011-05-25T08:25:56Z","timestamp":1306311956000},"page":"136-150","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"A Multi-Disciplinary Approach to Designing Business Management Games","prefix":"10.4018","author":[{"given":"Pedro","family":"Campos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Madeira & INESC ID Lisbon, Portugal"}]}],"member":"2432","reference":[{"key":"978-1-60960-569-8.ch009.-1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/104687819002100408"},{"key":"978-1-60960-569-8.ch009.-2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/002221949102400103"},{"key":"978-1-60960-569-8.ch009.-3","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Chang, Y., Lim, Y., & Stolterman, E.
