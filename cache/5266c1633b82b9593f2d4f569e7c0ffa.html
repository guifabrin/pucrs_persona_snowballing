This data is often made available to the public in the form of aggregated national level data or individual responses (microdata). Product designers likewise conduct surveys to better understand their customer and create personas. Personas are archetypes of the individuals who will use, maintain, sell or otherwise be affected by the products created by designers. Personas help designers better understand the person the product is designed for. Unfortunately, the process of collecting customer information and creating personas is often a slow and expensive process. In this paper, we introduce a new method of creating personas, leveraging publicly available databanks of both aggregated national level and information on individuals in the population. A computational persona generator is introduced that creates a population of personas that mirrors a real population in terms of size and statistics. Realistic individual personas are filtered from this population for use in product development.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/dsi.2019.409","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,26]],"date-time":"2019-07-26T12:36:58Z","timestamp":1564144618000},"page":"4019-4028","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":"The Personification of Big Data","prefix":"10.1017","volume":"1","author":[{"given":"Phillip Douglas","family":"Stevenson","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Christopher Andrew","family":"Mattson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,26]]},"reference":[{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref22","unstructured":"World Bank Group (2014), \u201cWorld development indicators 2014\u201d, World Bank Publications."},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref20","article-title":"Delft design guide: Design strategies and methods","author":"Van Boeijen","year":"2014","journal-title":"BIS Publishers"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref17","article-title":"Drinking water, sanitation and hygiene database, Technical report","year":"2017","journal-title":"UNICEF"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref14","article-title":"Toward a Universal Social Impact Metric for Engineered Products That Alleviate Poverty","volume":"140","author":"Stevenson","year":"2018","journal-title":"Journal of Mechanical Engineering"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref13","first-page":"830","article-title":"Persona development for information-rich domains, in \u2018CHI'03 extended abstracts on Human factors in computing systems","author":"Sinha","year":"2003","journal-title":"ACM"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref11a","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/997078.997089"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref11","volume-title":"The persona lifecycle: keeping people in mind throughout product design","author":"Pruitt","year":"2010"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref7","first-page":"1748","article-title":"Persona generation from aggregated social media data, in \u2018Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems","author":"Jung","year":"2017","journal-title":"ACM"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref6","article-title":"Global Financial Stability Report September 2005: Market Developments and Issues","author":"Fund","year":"2005","journal-title":"International Monetary Fund"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref5","article-title":"Universal methods of design: 100 ways to research complex problems, develop innovative ideas, and design effective solutions","author":"Hanington","year":"2012","journal-title":"Rockport Publishers"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref2","article-title":"The inmates are running the asylum:[Why high-tech products drive us crazy and how to restore the sanity]","author":"Cooper","year":"2004a","journal-title":"Sams Indianapolis"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref9c","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.18128\/D020.V7.1"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref21","article-title":"Defining your market: winning strategies for high-tech, industrial, and service firms","author":"Weinstein","year":"2016","journal-title":"Routledge"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref12","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2105\/AJPH.84.5.793"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref3","first-page":"26","article-title":"The origin of personas","volume":"23","author":"Cooper","year":"2004b","journal-title":"INNOVATION-MCLEAN THEN DULLES VIRGINIA"},{"key":"S2220434219004098_ref9a","unstructured":"Mikkelson N. and Lee W.
