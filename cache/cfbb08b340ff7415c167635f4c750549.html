Approximation is useful only if its impact on application output quality is acceptable to the users. However, there is a lack of systematic solutions and studies that explore users' perspective on the effects of approximation. In this paper, we seek to provide one such solution for the developers to probe and discover the boundary of quality loss that most users will deem acceptable. We propose AxGames, a crowdsourced solution that enables developers to readily infer a statistical common ground from the general public through three entertaining games. The users engage in these games by betting on their opinion about the quality loss of the final output while the AxGames framework collects statistics about their perceptions. The framework then statistically analyzes the results to determine the acceptable levels of quality for a pair of (application, approximation technique). The three games are designed such that they effectively capture quality requirements with various tradeoffs and contexts. To evaluate AxGames, we examine seven diverse applications that produce user perceptible outputs and cover a wide range of domains, including image processing, optical character recognition, speech to text conversion, and audio processing. We recruit 700 participants\/users through Amazon's Mechanical Turk to play the games that collect statistics about their perception on different levels of quality. Subsequently, the AxGames framework uses the Clopper-Pearson exact method, which computes a binomial proportion confidence interval, to analyze the collected statistics for each level of quality. Using this analysis, AxGames can statistically project the quality level that satisfies a given percentage of users. The developers can use these statistical projections to tune the level of approximation based on the user experience. We find that the level of acceptable quality loss significantly varies across applications. For instance, to satisfy 90% of users, the level of acceptable quality loss is 2% for one application (image processing) and 26% for another (audio processing). Moreover, the pattern with which the crowd responds to approximation takes significantly different shape and form depending on the class of applications. These results confirm the necessity of solutions that systematically explore the effect of approximation on the end user experience.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/2954679.2872376","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,6,10]],"date-time":"2016-06-10T13:54:00Z","timestamp":1465566840000},"page":"623-636","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"AxGames","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"51","author":[{"given":"Jongse","family":"Park","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"}]},{"given":"Emmanuel","family":"Amaro","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"}]},{"given":"Divya","family":"Mahajan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"}]},{"given":"Bradley","family":"Thwaites","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"}]},{"given":"Hadi","family":"Esmaeilzadeh","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","volume-title":"ISCA","author":"Esmaeilzadeh Hadi","year":"2011"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1109\/MM.2011.77"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_3_1","volume-title":"ASPLOS","author":"Venkatesh Ganesh","year":"2010"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_4_1","unstructured":"John Gantz and David Reinsel.
