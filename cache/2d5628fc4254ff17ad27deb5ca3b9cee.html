Changes in information and communications technology have enabled widespread sharing of personal photos, increasing access to aspects of private life previously less observable. Most studies of privacy online explore differences in individual privacy preferences. Here we examine privacy perceptions of online photos considering both social norms, collectively\u2014shared expectations of privacy and individual preferences. We conducted an online factorial vignette study on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (\n            <jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\n            = 279). Our findings show that people share common expectations about the privacy of online images, and these privacy norms are socially contingent and multidimensional. Use of digital technologies to share personal photos is influenced by social context as well as individual preferences, while such sharing can affect the social meaning of privacy.\n          <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1145\/3380960","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,7]],"date-time":"2020-07-07T12:34:24Z","timestamp":1594125264000},"page":"1-27","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":"Privacy Norms and Preferences for Photos Posted Online","prefix":"10.1145","volume":"27","author":[{"given":"Roberto","family":"Hoyle","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Oberlin College, Oberlin, OH"}]},{"given":"Luke","family":"Stark","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Microsoft Research"}]},{"given":"Qatrunnada","family":"Ismail","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"}]},{"given":"David","family":"Crandall","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN"}]},{"given":"Apu","family":"Kapadia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, IN"}]},{"given":"Denise","family":"Anthony","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI"}]}],"member":"320","reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_1_1_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1126\/science.aaa1465"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1509\/jmr.09.0215"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1145\/1240624.1240683"},{"key":"e_1_2_1_4_1","volume-title":"29th USENIX Security Symposium.
